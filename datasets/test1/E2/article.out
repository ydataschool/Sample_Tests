nigel reuben rook williams july april was an english conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass
from until his death he worked at the british museum where he became the chief conservator of ceramics and glass in
there his work included the successful restorations of the sutton hoo helmet and the portland vase
joining as an assistant at age williams spent his entire career and most of his life at the british museum
he was one of the first people to study conservation not yet recognised as a profession and from an early age was given responsibility over high profile objects
in the s he assisted with the re excavation of the sutton hoo ship burial and in his early to mid twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein most notably the sutton hoo helmet which occupied a year of his time
he likewise reconstructed other objects from the find including the shield drinking horns and maplewood bottles
the abiding passion of his life was ceramics and the s and s gave williams ample opportunities in that field
after nearly fragments of shattered greek vases were found in amidst the wreck of hms colossus williams set to work piecing them together
the process was televised and turned him into a television personality
a decade later in and williams s crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the portland vase one of the most famous glass objects in the world and put it back together
the reconstruction was again televised for a bbc programme and as with the sutton hoo helmet took nearly a year to complete
williams died at age of a heart attack while in aqaba jordan where he was working on a british museum excavation
the ceramics glass group of the institute of conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation
nigel williams was born on july in surrey england
his early schooling was interrupted by rheumatic fever and slowed by dyslexia yet he went on to study silversmithing and metal design at the central school of arts and crafts
there he excelled
the school recommended him to the british museum which recruited him in to work as an assistant for the department of british and medieval antiquities
conservation was not a recognized profession at the time and williams became only the second member of the museum to study the field in a three year part time course at university college london s institute of archaeology
after joining the british museum in and studying conservation williams worked on a wide variety of antiquities
he conserved metals including clocks and watches glass stone ivory wood and various other organic materials yet more than anything he worked with ceramics which became the abiding passion of his life
williams also proved skillful at working with archaeological finds among other tasks he saw to the lifting from the earth of a medieval tile kiln and a roman mosaic likely the hinton st mary mosaic thought to be one of the earliest known depictions of christ
his most significant work came at the beginning and the end of his professional life with his reconstructions of the sutton hoo helmet and the portland vase
between these achievements williams also pieced together the nearly fragments of greek vases found in the wreck of hms colossus and in was promoted to chief conservator of ceramics and glass a position he held until his death
the first major success for williams came during the re excavation of the sutton hoo ship burial from
in he was appointed the conservator of the finds and in the summer of he helped with the moulding of the ship impression
the following summer the casts were reassembled in a warehouse and a fibreglass replica made
the process was more dangerous than was then known and left williams allergic to styrene for the rest of his life
in as the re excavation at sutton hoo reached its conclusion and with problems apparent in the reconstructions of several of the finds williams was put in charge of a team tasked with their continued conservation
in this capacity he conserved many of the objects chiefly among them the helmet shield drinking horns maplewood bottles tubs and buckets
williams s colleagues at the museum termed the sutton hoo helmet his pi ce de r sistance the iconic artefact from england s most famous archaeological discovery it had previously been restored in by herbert maryon
williams took this reconstruction to pieces and from to he spent eighteen months of time and a full year of work rearranging the more than fragments
no photographs of the fragments in situ had been taken during the original excavation in nor were their relative positions recorded
as rupert bruce mitford who oversaw the work put it the task for williams was thus reduced to a jigsaw puzzle without any sort of picture on the lid of the box and as it proved a great many of the pieces missing fitting for williams who did jigsaw puzzles to relax
unveiled on november the new reconstruction was met with universal acclaim
it was published the following year by bruce mitford and posthumously by williams in
in a precursor to the work he would do on the portland vase the s saw nigel williams reconstructing fragments of smashed greek vases
the sinking of hms colossus had taken with it part of sir william hamilton s second vase collection where it lay in pieces for the next years
a salvage operation following the wreck s discovery unearthed some fragments and when they were acquired by the british museum williams set to work reconstructing them
this endeavour was aided by eighteenth century drawings of the vases by tischbein and shown on television where the instinctive talent of williams made him become a television personality
he worked as if he were alone and many people remember the moment in the resulting chronicle programme when he uttered a four letter word as one of his partially completed restorations fell apart before the cameras
in williams and his team restored seven vases in whole or in part for an exhibition at the museum in conjunction with the th international congress of classical archaeology
the other vases generally did not have enough pieces remaining to allow for complete reconstructions although ultimately individual examples were identified
the crowning achievement to williams s career wrote his museum colleague kenneth painter was his restoration of the portland vase
regarded as probably the most famous glass object in the world by the journal of glass studies the vase is a masterpiece of roman cameo glass
first recorded in the vase is dated to around b

or shortly afterward
it was placed on display in the british museum in and then intentionally smashed in by a young man who admitted to indulging in intemperance for a week before
it was restored the same year by john doubleday and then again in by j

by the adhesive used had yellowed and weakened and williams was tasked alongside his assistant sandra smith with restoring the vase for a third time
with the bbc s history and archaeology unit filming williams began the restoration of the vase in june
he deconstructed the vase by wrapping it inside and out with blotting paper and letting it sit in a glass desiccator injected with solvents for three days leaving it in pieces
after removing the remnants of the old adhesive and cleaning the fragments williams used an epoxy adhesive hxtal nyl in conjunction with an acrylic resin to join the pieces
although they attempted to avoid so called trap outs where the placing of a fragment prevents the next from fitting in williams and smith left for christmas in fearing that they might have to take apart six months work in order to fit in the last few shards
these fears proved unfounded a few more weeks spent working on the top half of the vase and the final pieces joined perfectly
at the end of nine months work only minuscule fragments remained unplaced rather than the that were omitted from the previous restoration
after filling in the cracks with coloured resin williams gave his verdict it s ok


ruined my christmas
for years williams lived with his partner myrtle bruce mitford a professional cellist and the daughter of his colleague rupert bruce mitford
the two met in
she likewise contributed to the sutton hoo finds being employed by the british museum to work on the remnants of the lyre and co authoring a paper with her father
she additionally revised and published the second edition of williams s text porcelain repair and restoration on which he had been working at the time of his death
williams and bruce mitford had a daughter matty who was born in or
nigel williams died of a heart attack on april at the age of
he had recently arrived in aqaba jordan and was taking a break on the beach from his work as the on site conservator for a british museum excavation at tell es sa idiyeh
though his death came early williams as painter wrote made a great contribution to the art and science of conservation to the archaeological record and to the preservation of great collections and above all to the public s appreciation and understanding of the past
the ceramics glass group of the institute of conservation awards the biennial nigel williams prize both in memory of his work and in encouragement of high standards for those in the conservation profession
noting the dramatic highlights of williams s career and that for most conservators today the opportunities to conserve or restore high profile objects such as the portland vase are rare the institute awards the prize as much in a spirit of encouragement as in that of healthy competition recognising the value of consistent and day to day professional practice
the three member judging panel is headed by sandra smith who restored the portland vase with williams while at the british museum along with the awarded to the winner comes a virtual image of a gilded replica of the vase the original copy of which was donated by wedgwood and is kept in their museum
